Yesterday once more

                                           
						
When I was young, I'd listen to the radio. Waiting for my favorite songs. When they played I'd sing along, it made me smile.
Those were such happy times and not so long ago. How I wondered, where they'd gone. But they're back again, just like a long lost friend.
All the songs I love so well, Every shalala every wo'wo,still shines. Every shing-a-ling-a-ling shing-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine. When they get to the part, where he's breaking her heart. It can really make me cry just like before.
It's yesterday once more, Shoobie do lang lang,Shoobie do lang lang. Looking back on how it was in years gone by. And the good times that I had makes today seem rather sad. So much has changed. It was songs of love that I would sing to them. 
And I'd memorise each word, Those old melodies still sound so good to me. As they melt the years away.
Every shalala every wo'wo still shines. Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing so fine. All my best memories come back clearly to me. Some can even make me cry just like before.
It's yesterday once more, Shoobie do lang lang. Every shalala every wo'wo still shines. Every shing-a-ling-a-ling that they're starting to sing, so fine. Every shalala every wo'wo still shines.
